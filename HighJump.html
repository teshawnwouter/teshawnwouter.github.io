                    <h2>My role</h2>
                    <p class="gamedisc">My pride and joy(for now). This is a solo project
                        that took inspiration from Only Up and Getting Over it. Its a difficult platformer where
                        most of my skills came from and are shown. I made wallrunning, grappling, swinging as wel as
                        basic movement. There isn't really anything i would change about this other than making the
                        level more longer. The moddle was made by me and rigged by me. It was the first time i had
                        used blender. This scored almost perfect on the exame it was for. Its also where i found the
                        style of coding that works the best for me.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Learning process</h2>
                    <p class="gamedisc">This project i have learned how making a contract works and how what works
                        best for me as a coder. I learned to be effecient with my work and how to get stuff done asap.
                        There are not many bad things i can say about the things i have learned to do in this project.
                        It holds a place in my heart
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <h2>Things i would improve</h2>
                    <p class="gamedisc">if i had more room and time i woudl make the level longer. I would also
                        implement online play if and player interactions where you can pull each other to yourself.
                        There would also be voice communication</p>
