                    <p class="explain">My Teshawn Wouter and I study and Grafisch Lyceum Utrecht. I can be a bit awkward and shy. There are a bunch of things that make me special. When I start work it takes a bit for me to get going and find my flow. When I get there, I can become an asset to a team even though my skills in a team are still improving. When I do get settled in, I can be very fun. When it comes to work flow and work environment, I like calm places and tend to get overwhelmed when itâ€™s too chaotic. Sometimes there are moments where I can feel down and have trouble admitting it and looking for help. Besides that, there are things I am good at I can work best solo but I do try my best to function in a team. I have work experience what with me having a job. I can bring a good solo worker to the work floor who is eager to learn and tries his best. A person who can seem shy but can also go with the flow if needed. There are somethings I wish to improve upon like working in teams, coding more efficiently, not making it harder for myself. I do have autism and can seem weird but if you teach me, I can pick it up quickly.</p>

                        <p class="discriptions">Getting over it Style platfromer with a robot making his way to find out whats on the top of a pillar <br><br/>My pride and joy(for now). This is a solo project that took inspiration from Only Up and Getting Over it. Its a difficult platformer where most of my skills came from and are shown. I made wallrunning, grappling, swinging as wel as basic movement. There isn't really anything i would change about this other than making the level more longer. The moddle was made by me and rigged by me. It was the first time i had used blender. This scored almost perfect on the exame it was for. Its also where i found the style of coding that works the best for me.</p>

                        <p class="discriptions">Brave hero who figths all the monster the world throws at him overwelming him he must fight till his last breath <br><br/>This was a rougelike -lite idea where i was also trying new things such as getter and setter. I had a plan on making a 2D combat systeem which worked really well. Also working with poly colliders and making costum ones to fit the attack swing of the character. There are a few enemys were most are the same but all have different stats and can be ajsuted on the fly. All enemies have their own attacks and own damage. If more time was given i would give the enemies more than a single attack.</p>

                        <p class="discriptions">Go through space and seek and rank up score see how many you can destroy. Use uniqe powers in your arsenal <br></br/>This game was my second shmup i made i was getting the hang of using scriptableObjects and trying new things like TimeSlow which reduses the Time Scale of the game. I also worked on a systeem that has perminant Upgrades and temporary powerUps. It was an over all blast to make and i was thrilled with the end result. I would have loved to add more to the Game but ultimately ran out of time. I had also made a blackHole which pulls in enemies and renderes them unable to get out till the ability is gone.</p>
