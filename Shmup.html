                        was getting the hang of using scriptableObjects and trying new things like TimeSlow which
                        reduses the Time Scale of the game. I also worked on a systeem that has perminant Upgrades
                        and temporary powerUps. It was an over all blast to make and i was thrilled with the end
                        result. I would have loved to add more to the Game but ultimately ran out of time. I had
                        also made a blackHole which pulls in enemies and renderes them unable to get out till the
                        ability is gone.</p>

                        game is where i learned what i wanted to do as a developer i know here that making good gameplay
                        was my dream. I manage to make a time slow, shield, and pull shot. Not much bad to say about
                        this project it was the start of my gameplay development days.

                        would be nice to improve upon as awell but it was the early days.</p>
