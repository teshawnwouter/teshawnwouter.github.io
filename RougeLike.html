                    <p class="gamedisc">This was a rougelike -lite idea
                        where i was also trying new things such as getter and setter. I had a plan on making a 2D
                        combat systeem which worked really well. Also working with poly colliders and making costum
                        ones to fit the attack swing of the character. There are a few enemys were most are the same
                        but all have different stats and can be ajsuted on the fly. All enemies have their own
                        attacks and own damage. If more time was given i would give the enemies more than a single
                        attack.</p>

                    <h2>Learning process</h2>
                    <p class="gamedisc">This was a game which pushed my knowledge of scriptableObjects to the max. I had
                        to use them in the project and wanted to make sure they were for the powerUps/magic. I have also
                        learned how Game design and and technical design work. This was the first time i had made one
                        and got use to it soon after. The power Ups also have random drop chance and either spawns in or
                        doesnt.

                    <h2>Things i would improve</h2>
                    <p class="gamedisc">If i had more time i would make more levels and double down on the comabt
                        systeem. I would make delay combos and would make status effects for the spells.</p>
